Chapter 15 of [Android Programming with Kotlin for Beginners](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07RLJNJHS). I am pretty familiar with `Array`s from other languages. `ArrayList` is a pretty easy-to-grasp extension, so no trouble here. `HashMap`s make more sense now after reading this. A use of `HashMap` is to be able to index an array by a human-readable, unique identifier.
