# [Activities and Intents Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-training-create-an-activity/index.html?index=..%2F..android-training#0)

## Coding Challenge Solution
**Challenge**: Create an app with three `Button` elements. When any of these `Button` elements are clicked, launch a second `Activity`. That second `Activity` should contain a `ScrollView` that displays one of three text passages (you can include your choice of passages). Use an `Intent` to launch the second `Activity` with extras to indicate which of the three passages to display.

## Notes/ Thoughts
