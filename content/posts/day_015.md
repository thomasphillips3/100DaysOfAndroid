Building on the Image Picker app in [Day 14](day_014.md), this allows the user to grant permissions from the app instead of having to manually do it from Android Settings. 

## [Requesting App Permissions](https://github.com/thomasphillips3/dreamr/pull/2)
<strike>Check for permissions at the point where they're needed. 

|Permission|Check point|
|---|---|
|`CAMERA`|`takePhotoFromCamera()`|
|`READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`|`choosePhotoFromGallery()`|
|`WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`|`saveImage(bitmap: Bitmap)`|
</strike>

I had trouble handling permissions manually, and since this isn't the main goal, I decided to work smarter instead of harder. I found the [QuickPermissions-Kotlin](https://github.com/QuickPermissions/QuickPermissions-Kotlin) library to make this suuuuuper easy. 

I added my dependencies: 

In the **project** `build.gradle`:
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url "http://jitpack.io/" }  
    }
}
```

Then in the **app**'s `build.gradle`
```
dependencies {
   implementation 'com.github.quickpermissions:quickpermissions-kotlin:0.4.0'
}
```

After this, on my method which requires permissions (`showPictureDialog()`), modify it to be

```
private fun showPictureDialog() = runWithPermissions(
    Manifest.permission.CAMERA,
    Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE,
    Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
) { ... }
```

So now the code within the `showPictureDialog()` method (`{ ... }`) will only be executed after requesting the listed permissions (`CAMERA`, `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`,  and `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` are granted.)
