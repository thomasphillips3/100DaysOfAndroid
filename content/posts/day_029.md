## Exercise 1: Beginning Reverse Engineering with `jadx`
You are a malware analyst for Android applications. You are concerned that this sample maybe doing premium SMS fraud, meaning that it sends an SMS to a premium phone number without disclosure & user consent.

Identify any of the application entry points described in the [Application Entry Points](https://maddiestone.github.io/AndroidAppRE/app_fundamentals.html#application-entry-points) section.

### Steps to Solution
* Open the APK in `jadx-gui`
* Check the `AndroidManifest.xml` for the app's entry point
Found an activity (`com.cp.Camera.Loading`) with the following `<intent-filter>`

```
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
</intent-filter>
```

I looked through the `Loading.java` file and found
```
public void sendMessage(String mobile, String content)
```

Within that method, there's a call to `sendTextMessage(...)`, which identifies what I'm looking for.

## Notes
* Static analysis: analyzing an application by examining its code, without executing it
* [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx): tools for producing Java source code from Android Dex and APK files
* [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/): software reverse engineering tools
* [SMALI](https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali) is like DEX assembly language - between the higher level source code (Java/ Kotlin) and the bytecode.
