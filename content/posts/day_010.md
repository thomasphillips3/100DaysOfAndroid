# [Synchronization, Thread-Safety and Locking Techniques in Java and Kotlin](https://proandroiddev.com/synchronization-and-thread-safety-techniques-in-java-and-kotlin-f63506370e6d)

## Notes

**With no lock**
> Imagine thereâ€™s one thinking room (the counter) and many people (threads) want to use it but only one person is allowed at a time. This room has a door that when the room is occupied, is closed. What happens in this scenario is, when one person is inside the room, other people can also open the door, come in and use the room. But the door needs a lock!

### Volatile
`@Volatile` fields guarantee that the value being read comes from the main memory and not from CPU cache. 

Reader always gets the value from main memory, but other threads can still read the value while another is incrementing it.

### Synchronized
Annotate a method or statement as `@Synchronized` to protect it from being changed on another thread. It's for thread-safety.

> `Synchronized` resembles a lock on the door that has only one key, that people need to use to open the door and lock it. So when one person (thread) goes in, they can use the key to lock the door, and since no one else has the key, they cannot go in until the key is returned to them by the original person. This is exactly what synchronized does in Java and Kotlin
