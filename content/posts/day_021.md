## [2.2: Drawing on Canvas Objects](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-canvas/index.html?index=..%2F..advanced-android-kotlin-training#0)

## Summary
* A `Canvas` is a 2D drawing surface that provides methods for drawing.
* The `Canvas` can be associated with a `View` instance that displays it.
* The `Paint` object holds the style and color information about how to draw geometries (such as line, rectangle, oval, and paths) and text.
* A common pattern for working with a canvas is to create a custom view and override the `onDraw()` and `onSizeChanged()` methods.
* Override the `onTouchEvent()` method to capture user touches and respond to them by drawing things.
* You can use an extra bitmap to cache information for drawings that change over time. Alternatively, you could store shapes, or a path.
